# Template-Designer-Registration

I want to create varities of theme for web design framework components by using HTML, CSS and Javascript/jQuery. Already we have web design framework available in online resource like Bootstrap, Foundation 5, UIKit...so on. By using this web design framework we can design only few themes, but we cannot change field styles.

Here my agenda is to create individual page theme each page have different field style
